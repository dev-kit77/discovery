                        <p>
                            On 28 March 1986, Discovery left London aboard the semi-submersible docklift ship Happy Mariner to make her journey home to the Scottish city that had built her. She arrived at Victoria Dock on the River Tay on 3 April – the first time she had been back to Dundee since her construction.

                        <h2>Discovery Point, Dundee</h2>

                        <p>
                            Placed in a custom-built dock in 1992, Discovery is now the centrepiece of Dundee's visitor attraction Discovery Point.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            She is displayed in a configuration as near as possible to her 1923 state, when she was refitted in the Vosper yard at Portsmouth. She is listed as part of the National Historic Fleet. Discovery Point is a fully accredited museum and has won numerous national awards, as well as being a 5-star rated tourist attraction with Visit Scotland. In 2008, Discovery and the associated polar collections were named as a Recognised Collection of National Significance.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Since the 1990s, the Discovery Point museum has concentrated on interpreting the vessel on all of her voyages, with personal items from the ship's crew as well as information on her scientific activities. Items range from the games played by the crew on her first expedition to examples of sea fauna. Star objects on display include Captain Scott's rifle and pipe.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Discovery's three main voyages, the National Antarctic Expedition (1901–1904), the Discovery Oceanographic Expedition (1925–1927) and the BANZARE expedition (1929–31), are all explored in the museum through film and photographic evidence with artefacts from each era represented. The museum also holds other pieces from Scott's subsequent Terra Nova expedition and Shackleton's Endurance expedition.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The ship also features on the crest of the coat of arms of the British Antarctic Territory.

                        <h2>Subsequent ships</h2>

                        <p>
                            There have been three subsequent royal research ships named Discovery. The second, RRS Discovery II (1929), and third, RRS Discovery (1962), subsequently left service. A fourth ship is the current RRS Discovery, which was built in 2013.[13][14]
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The spaceship Discovery One in Arthur C. Clarke's 1968 novel 2001: A Space Odyssey was named by Clarke after RRS Discovery; Clarke used to eat his lunch aboard her, as she was moored near the office where he worked in London.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Space Shuttle Discovery is named for RRS Discovery,[15] and other famous ships of the same name, particularly Captain Cook's HMS Discovery and Henry Hudson's Discovery.
