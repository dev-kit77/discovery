                            With increasing scientific and political attention being turned to the uncharted continent
                            of Antarctica during the late 19th century, numerous proposals arose for a British-mounted
                            expedition to the continent. The Royal Navy had been something of a pioneer with Antarctic
                            exploration, mounting the Ross expedition in 1839 which discovered the Ross Ice Shelf.
                            Attention had turned northward to the Arctic and attempts to reach the North Pole. The RN
                            mounted the British Arctic Expedition in 1874.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Towards the turn of the century, there was increasing pressure for a similar expedition to
                            the southern polar region. The British government and the Admiralty stopped short of
                            organising a government expedition but agreed to partially fund a project led by the two
                            main interested scientific organisations, the Royal Geographical Society and the Royal
                            Society. The Admiralty would provide practical support in designing and crewing a
                            purpose-built ship for the expedition, while the ship would be owned by the RGS.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Early discussions on building a dedicated polar exploration ship considered replicating
                            Fridtjof Nansen's ship Fram, but that vessel was designed specifically for working through
                            the pack ice of the Arctic. The British ship would have to cross thousands of miles of open
                            ocean before reaching the Antarctic, so a more conventional design was chosen. In charge of
                            her overall design was W.E. Smith, one of the senior naval architects at the Admiralty. The
                            ship's engine, boilers and other machinery were designed by Fleet Engineer Philip Marrack.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Smith borrowed many elements of his design from the Bloodhound, a Dundee-built whaling ship
                            taken into Royal Navy service as HMS Discovery for the Arctic Expedition. By 1900 few
                            shipyards in the United Kingdom had the capability to build wooden ships of the size needed
                            – only two shipbuilders submitted bids for the contract. The designers deemed it essential
                            that the ship be made from wood, both for strength and ease of repair, and to reduce
                            magnetic interference from a steel hull. They wanted to gain the most accurate navigation
                            and surveying.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The main compass was mounted perfectly amidships, and there were to be no steel or iron
                            fittings within 30 ft (9.1 m) of this point. The original cushions for the wardroom (just
                            aft and below the main bridge) were changed when it was found they included steel-backed
                            buttons. Similarly some of the wardroom cabins fell within this area, and their occupants
                            had to sleep on mattresses stuffed with horsehair. Others located at a distance had more
                            modern types of mattresses with steel springs inside. For the same reason of navigation, the
                            boilers and engine were mounted towards the stern of the ship, a feature which also provided
                            maximum space for equipment and provisions. A special laboratory for taking magnetic field
                            measurements was provided below the bridge.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The ship committee considered having the ship built in Norway by Framnæs, the yard which
                            would later build Endurance. But supporters believed that the British government's money
                            should be spent at a British yard. The new Discovery was built by the Dundee Shipbuilders
                            Company, which primarily made smaller vessels such as trawlers, tugboats and steam yachts.
                            The yard was previously owned by Alexander Stephen and Sons and had built the Terra Nova,
                            purchased by Scott for his last expedition, in 1884. The committee responsible for the
                            ship's construction offered a separate tender for her boilers, engine and auxiliary
                            machinery in an effort to reduce costs. Dundee Shipbuilders also won that order, but
                            sub-contracted the work to Gourlay Brothers, another Dundee engineering firm.

                        <p>
                            The ship cost £34,050 to build, plus another £10,322 to be fitted with engines and
                            machinery, and more than £6000 for other equipment and fittings. The total cost for the
                            Discovery was £51,000, equivalent to £4.1m in modern currency. Much of the detail work of
                            fitting out the ship's interior spaces, scientific equipment and provisions was overseen
                            directly by Scott and the ship's newly appointed engineer Reginald Skelton.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Discovery was fitted with a 450-horsepower coal-fired triple expansion steam engine, but had
                            to rely primarily on sail because the coal bunkers did not have sufficient capacity to take
                            the ship on long voyages. At her economical cruising speed of 6 kn (11 km/h), Discovery
                            carried enough coal for only 7,700 nmi (14,300 km) of steaming; the voyage to New Zealand
                            covered over 12,000 nmi (22,000 km). At 8 kn (15 km/h), she could steam only 5,100 nmi
                            (9,400 km).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The ship was considered to be a sailing vessel with auxiliary steam propulsion: when first
                            registered in 1900 Discovery was classified as a sailing ship. Her legal owners were the
                            Royal Geographical Society. As its president, Sir Clements Markham, was a member of the
                            Royal Harwich Yacht Club, Discovery was registered as a private sailing yacht of the RHYC.
                            She carried the official name and prefix 'S.Y. Discovery'. She flew the RHYC's burgee, the
                            emblem of the RGS as a house flag, and the Blue Ensign throughout her first expedition.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            She was rigged as a barque (the fore- and mainmasts being square rig and the mizzen mast
                            carrying a fore-aft sail), and the total maximum sail area was 12,296 sq ft (1,142.3 m2).
                            Following the practice of the most modern sailing ships of the time, the windjammers, she
                            carried split topsails to reduce the size of the deck crew needed to handle them. Her spars
                            and sails on the foremast and mainmast were identical to reduce the amount of spares carried
                            and allow easier repairs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The ship was rigged to carry several large staysails. The funnel was hinged at the base so
                            it could be laid on the deck when the mizzen staysail was rigged once at sea. The Discovery
                            was marginally faster under sail than she was under engine power – her record for distance
                            travelled in 24 hours is 223 nautical miles (413 kilometres), equivalent to 9.2 kn (17.0
                            km/h).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The ship has a massively built wooden hull designed to withstand being frozen into pack ice
                            and resist crushing. At the time of her launch, Discovery was widely held to be the
                            strongest wooden ship ever built. The hull frames, placed much closer together than was
                            normal, were made of solid sections of oak up to 11 in (28 cm) thick. The outer hull was
                            formed from two layers – one 6 in (15 cm) thick and an outer skin some 5 in (13 cm) thick.

                            A third lining was laid inside the frames, forming a double bottom and skin around almost
                            the entire hull. This meant that in places the hull was over 2 ft (61 cm) thick, providing
                            not only formidable strength but excellent insulation against the cold. The construction
                            made it impossible to install portholes (and fitting them would have weakened the hull), so
                            the crew relied on 'mushroom vents' on the deck to allow air and light into the interior.

                            The wood used for the planking varied depending on where in the ship it was laid and what
                            structural purpose it served: the inner layer is Scots pine while the 6 in (15 cm) skin is
                            made of pitch pine, Honduras mahogany or oak. The outer hull is made of English elm and
                            Greenheart. Oak beams run across the hull forming three decks – the lower deck beams are 11
                            in (28 cm) square in cross-section and are placed less than 3 ft (91 cm) apart along the
                            ship's length. Seven transverse bulkheads, also of wood, provide additional strength and
                            ensured that any ice damage would not flood the entire ship.

                            To prevent damage from ice floes or crushing, the two-blade propeller could be hoisted out
                            of the way and the rudder could be easily detached and stored aboard. A second rudder and
                            spare propeller blades were carried, and the ship could be steered by use of her sails if
                            her rudder or steering gear was completely disabled. Iron-shod bows were severely raked so
                            that when ramming the ice, they would ride up over the margin and crush the ice with
                            deadweight.

                            The coal bunkers on each side contained a steel compartment, each of which could hold 60
                            tons of fresh water. These would be filled on the long ocean trip to and from New Zealand
                            but for the Antarctic expedition the extra coal capacity was more important as ice and snow
                            could be melted each day to provide water, so the tanks would be filled with coal. The metal
                            tanks also contributed to the strength of the lower hull around the boiler and engine
                            spaces.

                            On 16 March 1900, in the context of significant donations to the approaching expedition by
                            patrons Llewellyn W. Longstaff and the British Government, construction on the Discovery
                            began in Dundee, Scotland, by the Dundee Shipbuilders Company. She was launched into the
                            Firth of Tay on 21 March 1901 by Lady Markham, the wife of Sir Clements Markham, President
                            of the Royal Geographical Society.
